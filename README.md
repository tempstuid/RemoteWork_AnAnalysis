üåç **Remote Work & Mental Health: A Data-Driven Exploration** üß†

The rise of remote work offers flexibility and global collaboration, while onsite work fosters direct interaction and team bonding. Remote setups reduce commuting stress but risk isolation and blurred boundaries, whereas onsite offers structure and social engagement. Both require companies to balance productivity, mental health, and team cohesion.

I‚Äôve always been the type to quietly observe patterns and make sense of them in my own time. Recently, I found myself curious about how **remote work** has impacted mental health. So, I dove into the **Remote Work and Mental Health** dataset on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health). The results?‚Ä¶ üìä

------

### **Why Does This Matter?**

Data suggests that remote work policies need to **evolve beyond flexibility**. To create sustainable work environments, organizations should focus on the mental well-being of their employees through structured, data-driven decisions. The dataset clearly shows that companies offering robust **mental health support** see more positive outcomes. This isn't just a "soft skill" focus‚Äîit‚Äôs a **strategic imperative** backed by data.

üíª **The Tools I Used**:

I used:

1. **Pandas** to manipulate the dataset, efficiently cleaning and transforming the data.
2. **NumPy** powered some of the heavier lifting with numeric computations.
3. **Matplotlib** brought the insights to life through engaging visualizations.
4. **Seaborn** for statistical visualisation
5. **PowerBI** to make an interactive dashboard.
6. **PostgreSQL** to query the data.

Data wrangling, filtering, and visualizing provided an intimate look into the numbers that went beyond the surface, offering insights that plain observation wouldn‚Äôt yield.

---

### **Insight 2: Hours Worked Per Week vs Stress Level ‚Äì More hours, more stress?**

**Insight:**

Employees working more hours a week report way higher stress than those working under 40 hours. It looks like working longer hours makes people more stressed!

**Takeaway:**

- Encourage employees to stick to a reasonable work schedule and not overwork themselves.

**Insight:**

Employees with access to mental health resources were more productive. This shows that when companies care about mental health, their workers perform better.

**Takeaway:**

- Provide mental health support, like counseling or apps, to keep employees healthy and productive.

---

### **Insight 4: Number of Virtual Meetings and Social Isolation ‚Äì Too many Zoom calls?**

**Insight:**

Employees who attend more than 10 virtual meetings per week reported higher social isolation. Too many virtual meetings can make people feel disconnected.

**Takeaway:**

- Try to reduce the number of meetings or switch to email/online tools to help employees avoid meeting overload.

---

### **Insight 5: Impact of Years of Experience on Stress Level ‚Äì Does experience make you zen?**

**Insight:**

Employees with less than 5 years of experience feel more stressed than those who have been working for over 10 years. It looks like experience helps reduce stress over time.

**Takeaway:**

- New employees should receive mentorship and guidance to help them cope with stress.

---

### **Insight 6: Relationship Between Company Support and Satisfaction with Remote Work ‚Äì Are companies making remote life sweet or salty?**

**Insight:**

People who feel supported by their company during remote work are 25% happier with their job than those who don‚Äôt feel supported.

**Takeaway:**

- Companies should provide strong remote work support, like regular check-ins, good communication tools, and clear guidelines.

---

### **Insight 7: Physical Activity and Sleep Quality Correlation ‚Äì Can you Netflix all day and expect to sleep like a baby?**

**Insight:**

Employees who stay physically active have better sleep quality. Being active helps you rest better at night.

**Takeaway:**

- Encourage employees to take breaks and do physical activities during the day to improve their sleep.

---

### **Insight 8: Work-Life Balance Rating by Industry ‚Äì Which industry is the work-life balance MVP?**

**Insight:**

Employees in the tech industry report better work-life balance compared to those in healthcare or education. This might be because tech roles often allow more flexible schedules.

**Takeaway:**

- Industries with lower work-life balance should look into offering flexible schedules and wellness programs.

---

### **Insight 9: Gender and Mental Health Conditions ‚Äì Do mental health struggles play favorites?**

**Insight:**

Women reported slightly higher rates of mental health conditions compared to men. This suggests that women might face more mental health challenges in the workplace.

---

### **Insight 10: Impact of Job Role on Productivity Change ‚Äì Some roles are productivity black holes... but which ones?**

**Insight:**

Employees in administrative roles saw less of a productivity boost compared to those in creative or technical roles. Some roles may struggle more with productivity in a remote setting.

**Takeaway:**

- Offer role-specific support and tools to help employees in less productive roles improve their output while working remotely.
